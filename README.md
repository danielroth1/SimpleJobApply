# SimpleJobApply
Tool that simplifies the generation of job applications by scanning for keywords and combining corresponding paragraphs.

This tool can automate parts of the process of generating a cover letter. A pasted job ad is scanned for keywords and a corresponding cover letter is automatically generated based on previously specified keyword / paragraph combinations. 

## Getting started
- Start the SimpleJobApply by running SimpleJobApply.exe
- Important: Save to a new file (click "Save")! Click the "Save" button whenever you made changes that you don't want to lose.
- Use ChatGPT (or another language AI) to generate paragraphs related to certain skills of yours.
- In SimpleJobApply create a new paragph and paste the text in the content field. Think about matching keywords that might appear in job ads. While looking for jobs refine these keywords.

To see an example on what a refined paragraphs could look like, open example-full-stack.sja from the main folder.

## While job searching
- Copy job ads by selecting the position related parts (skip the intro and benefits section) and copy it to clipboard (ctrl + c).
- Click "PasteJobAd" which generates a cover letter by combining paragraphs that have keywords that appear in the job ad. (see picture below)
- Check if the keyword actually reflects the paragraph by looking through the highlighted keywords in the job ad. Depending on if they match, select/deselect the paragraph (the check box to the left). This adds/removes it from the generated text.
- Once happy, click "Generate + Copy to clipboard"
- Open a template with header "Application for [insert job title]" in MS Word / Libre Office and paste without formatting (Ctrl + Shift + V)
- Generate a starting sentence with ChatGPT (e.g. with the prompt "Generate starting sentence for cover letter with following points: - ...")
- If there is a name of contact person, don't forget to put that name in instead of the usual "Dear Sir or Madam,"

Note, this is an iterative process that requires a little bit of work in the beginning! To increase your chances, don't take the generated cover letter for granted. Use it as a basis and add job specific information. You can also use this tool for your CV writing bullet points instead of paragraphs. Simply run SimpleJobApply twice (once for the Cover Letter and once for the CV) and paste the job ad in each instance.
